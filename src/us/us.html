                <h2>Our story</h2>

                <p>Aisha and Cameron met through the Honors College at Western Washington University in Bellingham, WA. They had
                    mutual Honors classes for the first two quarters and they both lived in Edens Hall; Aisha was on the third
                    floor and Cameron on the second. While there were multiple group activities they both attended, their courtship
                    truly began when Aisha took initiative during a dorm movie night. Aisha can‚Äôt sit still during any movie,
                    so she wiggled next to Cameron throughout
                    <i>The Producers</i> until she finally enticed him to hold her hand. (That movie still comes up most evenings
                    around 8:30 when Aisha starts singing ‚Äúbedtime for Aisha and Cameron‚Äù to the tune of ‚ÄúSpringtime for Hitler
                    in Germany.‚Äù)</p>

                <p>There was a lot of hand-holding and smoothie dates during the subsequent two weeks. There was even an impromptu
                    ski adventure through campus during an unexpected snow storm. Aisha was hoping they would share their first
                    kiss sitting outside a snow igloo on Old Main Lawn, but Cameron wasn‚Äôt ready to initiate. Aisha wasn‚Äôt willing
                    to wait much longer, so she kissed him for the first time on January 16, 2012 while watching
                    <i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i> in Aisha‚Äôs dorm room. Cameron finally asked to ‚Äúmake it Facebook official‚Äù
                    after the movie was over.</p>

                <p>Throughout their remaining college years, Cameron took Aisha on her first backpacking trip and puddle run (Aisha
                    only agreed to run because she was trying to impress him, but the charade didn‚Äôt last long because of her
                    lack of running abilities). While Aisha didn‚Äôt introduce Cameron to anything specifically interesting, they
                    both agree that he is now a more assertive person because of her.</p>

                <p>While both had multiple job offers, they agreed to accept positions in Seattle after college. In June, 2015 they
                    moved into their first shared apartment in Bellevue, WA. During the 3+ years in that apartment Aisha became
                    a CPA, they adopted their rabbits
                    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://instagram.com/fizzandluna">Fizz and Luna</a>, and Cameron bought a drone. They plan to stay in that apartment until they choose to leave
                    Seattle and buy their first house.</p>

                <p>Before they become engaged both knew marriage was on the table, however, Aisha had numerous stipulations for
                    the proposal. By October 2017 Cameron finally felt he could satisfy most of the stipulations. Cameron and
                    Aisha joined their friends for a weekend visiting Halloween Town in Oregon. The morning before the main event,
                    Cameron lead the group on a short walk to Beaver Falls. After crossing the creek and walking behind the falls,
                    Cameron
                    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BaWk5Szn4zp/">got down on one knee</a> and Aisha said ‚Äúyes.‚Äù</p>
